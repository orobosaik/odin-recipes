    <h2>To die for blueberry muffins</h2>

    <p>These muffins are extra large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top edge for a wonderful, extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin. Add extra blueberries too, if you want!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Muffins:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>⅓ cup milk, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Crumb Topping:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, cubed</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups or line with muffin liners.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark. Stir until combined. Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries. Set batter aside.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon for crumb topping in a small bowl. Mix with a fork until crumbly.</li>
        <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right to the top. Sprinkle with crumb topping.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
